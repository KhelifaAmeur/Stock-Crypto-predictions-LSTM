# Stock-Crypto-predictions-LSTM
The LSTM approach is used in an effort to predict closing Stock and/or Cryptocurrency prices. It should be noted that the code written is relatively baseline and I doubt profits can be made solely following this program. As a matter of fact, prices hugely depend on a plethora of factors. To mention a few: the general sentiment (fear and greed index https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), trends (Bear vs Bull), electionsâ€¦
Consequently, the purpose of this program is mainly to showcase that, with a relatively low computing power, and widely available data, one can build a program that can quite accurately follow the course of the market. 
The core idea behind this approach is to use the past 60-day data as the Xtrain (entry data) and the following day (the 61st day) as the Ytrain (prediction). 

For more in-depth analysis of the approach, I invite you to read "Predicting Prices using LSTM Rapport.pdf"
